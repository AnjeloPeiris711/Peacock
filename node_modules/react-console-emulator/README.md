A simple, powerful and highly customisable Unix terminal emulator for React.

[Live demo](https://linuswillner.me/react-console-emulator/)  
[Configuration guide](docs/CONFIG.md)  
[Command API](docs/API.md)

## Features

- Highly customisable: Add custom responses, restyle and tweak the terminal to your liking and much more.
- A Unix terminal in the browser: Accurately emulate a native Unix terminal in the browser with no setup required.
- Familiar shortcuts: The terminal can keep track of commands and allows the user to recall them at their behest.
- Easy and powerful command system: Execute code from your own application and send the results to the terminal output.
- Async output support: Push output to the terminal at any time, even after a command response has been emitted.
- Unlimited concurrency: Register as many terminals as you like with no risk of input confusion.

## Usage

    fn: (...args) => args.join(' ')
  }
}

export default class MyTerminal extends Component {
  render () {
